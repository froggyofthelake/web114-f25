I chose this project after looking through the list of selected projects because my wife chimed in and said it'd be cute if I made a bunny game.
We decided we'd team up and make the game together, with myself writing the code and story, and her making the art.
This is probably the most complete "game", I've ever made, despite fiddling with game programming and development in the past, so I learned a fair bit of how to make it look and feel nice.
I started by writing in the main story logic and figuring out how I wanted to make it go from one choice to the next.
Then, I added the combat system. The trickiest part of it was probably working out how to implement a fight with HP bars into the "select-a-choice" setup I had made. It felt a little hacky, but it worked out in the end!
Finally, in came the important styling details, character creation and end credits screens, and a few little animations. I wanted to do more, but things got in the way and we didn't quite have time to make everything work.
I may continue adding to this after I submit it, or I'll make it into a proper game in an engine like Godot.
